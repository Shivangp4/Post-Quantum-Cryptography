## Post-Quantum Cryptography

As a part of CS674 post-quantum cryptography, I implemented the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) according to NewHope protocol using Cooley-Tukey divide and conquer approach. NTT (and inverse NTT) was used to calculate polynomial multiplication in Ring $R_q / x^n +1$ in O(nlogn) time/
